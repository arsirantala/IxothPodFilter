# IxothPodFilter
FIlter file for Path of Diablo

# General

This loot filter hides following things:

* inferior items (i.e. low quality items)
* potions (not full rejuv) after certain character level
* blue normal and exceptional unid items (including arrows and bolts)
* all other items (not runeword, set or uniques) which are not matched by the filter (elite/normal/exceptional items which are not weapons or armors). See the end of this file
* id scrolls after certain character level
* gold stacks based on character level

This filter is (in some parts) Based on Kryszard's Loot Filter version 1.9. Credits goes to him/her on respective parts of the filter).


# Notes

As long there is no way to get a simply the item's basename (similarly to ILVL) from loot filteration QOL feature, this item.filter will show both [s] superior <item name> in case of superior item. I tried to get rid of the superior prefix, but it made the filter so laggy to use (especially in maps). WIth ehtereal items this works without "tricks" as ethereal is not a prefix in item's name (its just shown with reduced opacity).
